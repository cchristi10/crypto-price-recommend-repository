Are there any sub-optimal choices( or short cuts taken due to limited time ) in your implementation?
The web page displays static prices instead of real time changes in prices.
 
Is any part of it over-designed? ( It is fine to over-design to showcase your skills as long as you are clear about it)
No
 
If you have to scale your solution to 100 users/second traffic what changes would you make, if any?
I would consider optimizing the requests to the API of the exchanges so that user requests from the webpage wouldnâ€™t cross the limit of requests set by exchanges.
 
What are some other enhancements you would have made, if you had more time to do this implementation
On the Backend side, I would have automated the process of requesting prices from exchanges for a reasonable amount of time so that users would get accurate and real time prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum on webpages.
On the Frontend side, I would add some animations to reflect changes in prices and recommendations. I would spend some more time on the layout, text, table, grid system, buttons to make the webpage more appealing and user friendly.
